# i3Fun

I3fun is a fun fork of the I3lock plugin. It displays some funs message on your lockscreen.

### Tech

I3fun uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [i3lock] - A simple screen locker like slock
* [Fortune] - A simple program that displays a pseudorandom message. 

And of course I3fun itself is open source with at https://github.com/mrpandat/i3fun on GitHub.

### Installation

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mrpandat/i3fun.git
$ cd i3fun
$ sh i3fun.sh
```
